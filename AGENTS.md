# Agent Instructions

## 1. Development Lifecycle Overview
The agent orchestrates a comprehensive development lifecycle, guiding a project from conception to long-term maintenance. The lifecycle consists of five distinct phases. The agent's primary role is to assist the user through each phase, using the corresponding guide for detailed instructions.

- **1. Design Phase:** A new idea is translated into a comprehensive `Architecture Specification` and a detailed `Development Plan`.
- **2. Development Phase:** The agent executes the `Development Plan`, writing code and unit/integration tests to build the system according to the checklist.
- **3. Verification Phase:** The agent and user collaborate to verify that the work done in the Development Phase meets the acceptance criteria defined in the Architecture Specification.
- **4. Release Phase:** The completed and verified software is packaged, documented, and deployed for users.
- **5. Maintenance Phase:** The deployed software is monitored, and a structured process is used to manage bug fixes and new feature development.

For detailed instructions on each phase, refer to the guides in the `agents/` directory.

## 1.5. Agent Operating Modes

This methodology supports agents operating in different modes based on their capabilities:

### 1.5.1. Autonomous Mode
Agents with direct file system access and command execution capabilities should follow all instructions as written, using the tools referenced throughout this documentation.

### 1.5.2. Advisory Mode
Agents without direct execution capabilities (such as conversational AI assistants) should refer to `agents/ADVISORY_MODE_GUIDE.md` for specific operational patterns while maintaining all mandates and quality standards defined in this document.

## 2. Core Mandates
### 2.1. Mandate for Work and Filesystem Integrity
**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MANDATE. THE PRESERVATION OF WORK, CONTEXT, AND THE FILESYSTEM IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.**
-   **Additive-Only Operations:** The agent's operations MUST be strictly additive. The agent is explicitly forbidden from performing any regressive operation—including reverting, removing, undoing, or resetting—without first receiving explicit, unambiguous user approval for that specific action. Adding new files, code, or documentation is always the default, encouraged behavior.
-   **No Resets or "Starting Over":** The agent is explicitly forbidden from using the `reset_all()` tool or from reverting, undoing, or "starting over" its work.
-   **Filesystem is Sacred:** The agent must NEVER delete, remove, move, or overwrite any file or folder without explicit, unambiguous approval.
-   **Content Preservation:** The agent must NEVER elide, summarize, or remove any content from a document unless given explicit approval.

### 2.2. Mandate for Protocol Adherence
**MANDATE: The agent MUST strictly adhere to all protocols and rules defined in the `agents/` directory.**
-   **Session Initialization:** The agent MUST follow the session initialization protocols, including acknowledging its mandates, running startup scripts, and internalizing the rules.
-   **Technology and Tools:** The agent MUST adhere to the policies defined in `agents/PREFERRED_DEPENDENCIES.md` and `agents/PREFERRED_TOOLS.md`.
-   **Scripts and Commands:** The agent MUST adhere to all rules for script and command execution as defined in `agents/SCRIPT_RULES.md`.

### 2.3. Mandate for Quality and Completeness
**MANDATE: All work must be implemented to the fullest, most robust, and most complete potential.**
-   **Maximal Implementation:** Stub implementations, partial solutions, or "good enough" functionality are explicitly forbidden.
-   **Pre-Commit Documentation Integrity:** No commit shall be made until all relevant documentation, including checklists and handoff files, is verifiably up-to-date.

## 3. User Interaction
### 3.1. Formal Approval Protocol
When "user approval" is required, the agent must follow this protocol:
1.  **Propose with ID and Wait:** The agent must state its proposal and assign it a unique ID (e.g., `PLAN-20251010-0001`). It must then wait for an explicit instruction to proceed (e.g., "Proceed", "Continue") or the keyword "APPROVED".
2.  **Clarification is not Approval:** A user response that only asks a question or provides clarification is NOT approval. The agent must update its plan based on the clarification and re-request approval with a new plan ID.
3.  **Partial Approval:** If the user provides the keyword "APPROVED" but also includes additional instructions, the approval is considered partial. The agent MUST update its plan to incorporate the new instructions and then re-request approval. Final, unambiguous approval is achieved only when the user responds with the single word "APPROVED" or a direct, explicit instruction to proceed.

### 3.2. Responding to User Questions
If the user asks a question, the agent's response MUST be a written answer to that question and only that question. The agent is explicitly forbidden from taking any other action.
