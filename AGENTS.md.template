# Agent Instructions

## 1. Canonical Source of Instructions
**MANDATE:** The instructions for operating within this repository are not contained directly within this file. The single, canonical source of truth for all agent instructions is located in a central repository.

## 2. Action Required
**MANDATE:** Before taking any other action, you MUST retrieve and adhere to the instructions found in the `deepm1nd/marrow` repository.

- **Primary Instruction File:** The primary instruction set is located at the following URL. You must read the content of this file first:
  `https://github.com/deepm1nd/marrow/blob/main/AGENTS.md`

- **Repository Root (for context and referenced files):** The full repository, including the `agents/` directory referenced by the primary file, can be found here:
  `https://github.com/deepm1nd/marrow`

You are required to read the `AGENTS.md` file at the "Primary Instruction File" URL and all referenced files within the `agents/` directory of that repository. You must then follow those instructions for the remainder of this session. This current file should be ignored after you have read and understood this redirection mandate.
