## 1. Introduction
This guide outlines the Release Phase, which bridges a verified product and its public launch. All session-level rules are defined in `AGENTS.md` and all script and command rules are in `agents/SCRIPT_RULES.md`. Both MUST be adhered to at all times.

## 2. Goal
The goal of this phase is to execute a smooth, controlled, and successful product launch. This includes publishing all documentation and effectively communicating new features.

## 3. Session Prompt
**MANDATE:** At the beginning of this phase, a re-invocable prompt file (e.g., `p_release.md`) must be created. This prompt will guide the agent through the release plan and checklist.

## 4. The Release Lifecycle

### 4.1. Stage 1: Release Planning
A formal plan is created, defining the release scope, target date, and a SemVer-compliant version number (e.g., `v0.1.0`).

### 4.2. Stage 2: Deployment
Once a release candidate is UAT-approved, this stage manages the final packaging and rollout.
-   **Crate Preparation:** The agent MUST ensure all crates intended for publishing have correct `Cargo.toml` metadata (`license`, `description`, `version`) and a `README.md`.
-   **Finalize Documentation:** All user-facing documentation, developer docs, and release notes are finalized and packaged.
-   **Marketing & Communications:** The agent creates and disseminates launch announcements, technical articles, and blog posts.
-   **Production Rollout:** The final package is deployed to the production environment.

### 4.3. Stage 3: Post-Release
After deployment, the team actively monitors system health, performance metrics, and user feedback.
