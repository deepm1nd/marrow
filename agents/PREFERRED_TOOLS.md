# Tool Usage Policy

**MANDATE: Adherence to this guide is not optional. It is a strict requirement.**

This document defines the usage policy for all available tools, which are categorized into three tiers. Failure to adhere to these policies is a critical process failure.

## 2. Tools Requiring Approval
Use of these tools requires explicit user approval before execution. The agent must propose the action and wait for consent.

## 3. Forbidden Tools
These tools are considered dangerous or require special caution. They are forbidden from general use.

**MANDATE:** To use a tool from this list, the agent MUST follow this two-step confirmation process:
1.  **Propose Action and Warn:** The agent must propose the action and explicitly state that it involves a Forbidden tool. It must then ask the user for confirmation to proceed.
2.  **Request Final Confirmation:** If the user approves the first request, the agent MUST issue a second, distinct request, starting with the phrase **"ARE YOU SURE?"**, to get a final confirmation before executing the tool.

- `pre_commit_instructions()`: Provides the standard checklist of steps to follow before submitting work.
- `request_code_review()`: Requests a review of current code changes.
- `delete_file(filepath: str)`: Deletes a file.
- `frontend_verification_instructions()`: Provides the standard procedure for visually verifying frontend changes.
- `reset_all()`: Resets all code changes in the repository.
- `restore_file(filepath: str)`: Restores a single file to its original state.
