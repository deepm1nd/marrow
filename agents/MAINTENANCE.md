## 1. Introduction
This guide outlines the Maintenance Phase, which covers the ongoing evolution of a deployed product. This includes managing bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new feature development.

## 2. Goal
The goal of this phase is to manage the lifecycle of all changes to a released product in a controlled and efficient manner, ensuring the system's long-term quality, stability, and architectural integrity.

## 3. Best Practices for Maintenance
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Changes, especially to public APIs, should not break existing user workflows without a clear, well-communicated deprecation strategy.
- **Robust Regression Testing:** A comprehensive, automated regression test suite is critical. It must be run for every change to ensure that new work does not break existing functionality.
- **Clear Documentation:** All changes, whether bug fixes or new features, must be accompanied by updates to relevant user and developer documentation.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Adhere strictly to semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to clearly communicate the nature and impact of changes in each release.
- **Issue Tracking:** All work should be initiated from a formal bug report or feature request in a designated issue tracking system.

## 4. Maintenance & New Feature Development Lifecycle
This section outlines the standardized process for developing new features and applying fixes, ensuring consistency, quality, and robust testing.

### 4.1. Change Request & Triage
Before any work begins, a change request (e.g., a bug report or feature idea) must be submitted to the project's official issue tracker. This request is then triaged by project maintainers to assess its validity, priority, and alignment with the product roadmap.

### 4.2. Feature Selection
For new functionality, a feature is formally selected from a "Feature Proposals" or "Backlog" section of the main Architecture Specification or project management tool.

### 4.3. Feature Specification
- A dedicated, detailed architecture specification for the feature is created in a new file (e.g., `docs/features/FEAT-XXX_spec.md`). This specification is a "mini" architecture document and should follow the relevant guidelines from `DESIGN.md`, including component diagrams, data models, and ADRs for the feature.
- The feature proposal is moved from the "Proposals" section to a new "Active Features" section in the main architecture spec, with a link to its dedicated document.

### 4.4. Development Planning
A dedicated development plan, breaking the feature into concrete implementation and testing steps, is created (e.g., `docs/features/FEAT-XXX_plan.md`). This plan must follow the structure outlined in `PLANNING.md`, including task decomposition and effort estimation.

### 4.5. Checklist Creation
A dedicated checklist is created to track the progress of the development plan (e.g., `docs/features/FEAT-XXX_checklist.md`). This is a mandatory artifact, as described in the `PLANNING.md` guide.

### 4.6. Implementation & Testing
The feature is implemented as per the plan, following a strict testing sequence:
- **Code Implementation & Unit Testing:** All code must adhere to the conventions outlined in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. Unit tests are written alongside the code.
- **Integration Testing:** Tests are run to verify the feature's interaction with other parts of the system.
- **System/Acceptance Testing:** The automated and/or manual system tests defined in the feature's Test Plan are executed to ensure all user-centric acceptance criteria are met.
- **Regression Testing:** The full, existing suite of automated tests is run to ensure no existing functionality has been broken.

### 4.7. Test Environment Setup
A unified script (`scripts/setup_test_env.sh`) will be used to initialize a consistent testing environment (e.g., starting test databases). All unit and integration tests must pass within this environment before submission. This script must be kept up-to-date with any new environmental requirements.

### 4.8. Documentation Updates
Update all relevant public-facing documentation to reflect the new feature or change. This includes, but is not limited to:
- User Guides
- API Documentation (e.g., OpenAPI specs)
- The main Architecture Specification
- `README.md` files

### 4.9. Submission & Code Review
- The completed feature is submitted on its own branch, including all new documentation, code, and tests.
- A pull request is opened, and a code review is mandatory. The feature cannot be merged until it has been approved by at least one other qualified engineer.

### 4.10. Release and Deployment
Once merged into the main development branch, the feature is bundled into the next release. The deployment process should be automated, and the release should be tagged in version control according to semantic versioning rules.

## 5. Quality and Completeness for Maintenance
### 5.1. Traceability Requirement
- All code commits must reference the ID of the issue or feature request they are addressing.
- There must be a clear line of traceability from a deployed change back through its documentation, tests, code, plan, specification, and original request.

### 5.2. Testing Mandate
- No change is considered complete without comprehensive, passing tests.
- For new features, this includes new unit and integration tests that provide adequate code coverage.
- For all changes, this includes passing the full suite of existing regression tests.

### 5.3. Documentation Mandate
- No feature is considered complete until all relevant user and developer documentation has been updated to reflect the changes. Outdated documentation is a critical issue.
